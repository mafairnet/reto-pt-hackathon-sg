Every time you do a transaction, it gets included in a block (which is all the recent transactions bundled together) and every 10 minutes or so, that new block gets accepted into the stack of blocks called the blockchain. So that's how it works every 10 minutes the whole network breathes, and updates network wide with the new block of transactions. Mining serves the purpose of verifiying these new blocks."]},

Unfortunately, the difference is not so great (about 1%), and if you do only one transaction for a small amount, then your capital does not increase by much, but if you do the deal constantly with a lot of, you can get rich very quickly. We discovered this flaw recently and have not yet managed to win a lot, but every day we multiply our money a hundred times and we want to make it more reliable. We all understand that such freebies can not last long, and most likely this will be found and corrected in the near future, but until that happens, we want to win as much as possible."]},
