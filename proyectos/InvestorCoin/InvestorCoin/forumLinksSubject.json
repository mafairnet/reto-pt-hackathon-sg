Someone who was associated with a company which was into Bitcoin Mining and was promoting itself through MLM and networking approached me telling the concept of Bitcoin and story of Satoshi Nakamoto.\u00a0 Initially it appeared a ponzi scheme and a kid's story but as I realized the potential of Bitcoins I got deeply interested into it. That time I was trying to learn blogging. As this topic of Bitcoin got me interested I started reading and writing about Bitcoins. Soon I had a blogsite : infoaboutbitcoins dot com, where I wrote basics about Bitcoins for learners. To this day I am so fond of Bitcoins.
